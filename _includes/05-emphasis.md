Hello there! My name is Lakshya Khatri. I'm pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science. I'm really passionate about creating different projects. I try to be creative and apply different technologies to solve my day to day problems. I am also good at learning things. I am fond of **Machine learning**, **Python Programming** and **Android Development**. My key skills include **Python**, **C++**, **Machine Learning**, **Django Framework**, **Android Development**, **Data Scrapping**, **PHP**, **Javascript** and **Image Processing**. I have recently started contributing to *Open Source* projects and I'm already in love with it. I hope that I can make a good impact on society with my skills. :heart:
